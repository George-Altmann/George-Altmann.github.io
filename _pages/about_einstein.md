I am currently a first year PhD student in the Algebra Group of the School of Mathematics, University of Leeds, supervised by Dr Joao Faria Martins (University of Leeds) and Dr Cristina Palmer-Anghel (Universit√© Clermont Auvergne). My research is mainly focused on knot invariants, specifically invariants of welded virtual links, and the associated representations of the braid and loop braids groups. More generally I am intereseted in the fields of representation theory, low-dimensional topology, quantum topology and TQFTs. 

I obtained an MMath at the University of Leeds in July 2023, as well as a PGCE in secondary mathematics education from Leeds Beckett University in July 2024.

My research is part of the Programme Grant [Combinatorial Representation Theory: Discovering the Interfaces of Algebra with Geometry and Topology](https://sites.google.com/view/crt-leeds/home)
