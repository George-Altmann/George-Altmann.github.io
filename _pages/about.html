My research is mainly focused on knot invariants, specifically invariants of welded virtual links, and the associated representations of the braid and loop braids groups. More generally I am intereseted in the fields of representation theory, low-dimensional topology, quantum topology and TQFTs.</p> <p>I obtained an MMath at the University of Leeds in July 2023, as well as a PGCE in secondary mathematics education from Leeds Beckett University in July 2024.</p> <p>My research is part of the Programme Grant <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/crt-leeds/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Combinatorial Representation Theory: Discovering the Interfaces of Algebra with Geometry and Topology</a></p> </body></html>
